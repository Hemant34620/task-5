 Wireshark Packet Capture â€“ Summary
I used Wireshark on a Windows system to capture and analyze network traffic over a Wi-Fi interface.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed:
Installed Wireshark with default settings (including Npcap).

Started packet capture on the active Wi-Fi interface.

Generated traffic by:

Visiting websites (like Google and Wikipedia)

Running ping google.com from Command Prompt

Stopped the capture after 1 minute.

Applied protocol filters (dns, http, tcp) to analyze traffic.

Exported the capture file as capture1.pcap.

ðŸ”¹ Protocols Identified:
Protocol	Purpose
DNS	Resolves domain names to IP addresses
HTTP	Transfers web data (like GET requests)
TCP	Handles transport of data (connection establishment)
(Bonus) ICMP	Used by the ping command
(Bonus) TLS	Secure encrypted HTTPS traffic

ðŸ”¹ Observations:
DNS queries were sent to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS).

HTTP packets clearly showed GET requests to visited sites.

TCP packets included SYN, ACK for connection setup.

Secure sites used TLS instead of HTTP.

Exported .pcap file for further analysis or sharing.
